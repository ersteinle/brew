        <p>Hello, My Name is Eric<br /><br />
        I live in The Region (NW Indiana) and I love beer. We have some fantastic breweries right here in the 219,
         which not only serve great beer, but also host some great events. I wanted to make a site that helps share this
        info, and lets us know what is happening in the brewery world. Whether it's a beer fest, brewery hosted concert, release party, or 
        new brewery opening, it's got a spot right here on BrewRegion.com.
        <br /><br />
        I hope everyone likes the site, it's for you guys. I'm open to suggestions and ideas to make the site
        exactly the way visitors like. And if people like it, I'm open to expanding to include areas outside of The Region.
        <br /><br />
        Thanks for your support. Cheers!</p>
